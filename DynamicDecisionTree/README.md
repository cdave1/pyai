Decision Tree
=============

Use the following to run the program:
    % python dtree.py training_filename testing_filename

Example (this will produce output similar to that found in "sampleoutput.txt"):
    % python dtree.py hepatitis-training.data hepatitis-test.data

Notes
=====

Both input parameters are required to run the program.  If a test file is not specified, the program will crash.
